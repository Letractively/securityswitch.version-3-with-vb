Version 3.1.3 - October, 2007
-----------------------------
• Moved the event handler that processes the request from the application's BeginRequest event to the PostAcquireRequestState event. This ensures that the session ID is available for cookie-less session processing.

Version 3.1.2 - July, 2007
--------------------------
• Added the BeforeEvaluateRequest event to allow subscribers the ability to cancel the evaluation of the current request.
  Create a handler in Global.asax defined as public void SecuritySwitch_BeforeEvaluateRequest(object sender, EvaluateRequestEventArgs e).

Version 3.1.1.1 - December, 2006
--------------------------------
• Bug fix: Accounted for a provided encryptedUri or unencryptedUri without the other.

Version 3.1.0.1 - November, 2006
--------------------------------
• Bug fix: With the added support for cookieless sessions, a bug arose where the request's query string was no longer being copied over during a redirect.

Version 3.1 - October, 2006
---------------------------
• The module now accounts for cookieless sessions when redirecting without a specified encryptedUri or unencryptedUri.
• A tiny change was made to the RequestEvaluator.Evaluate method that allows you to force an evaluation, despite the mode setting in the configuration. This should allow for better testing and simulation.

Version 3.0.1 - March, 2006
---------------------------
• Bug fix: The VB source code had a typo in the SSLHelper class. Url.Replace("'", "/") is now Url.Replace("//", "/").
• Bug fix: The RequestEvaluator class calculates the relative file path via the absolute URL, but spaces in the URL were being returned encoded. This was causing errors with the rest of the calculations. The absolute URL is now being decoded before further manipulations are made.

Version 3.0 - March, 2006
-------------------------
• Ported to .NET 2.0.
• Configuration re-written to conform to the new Configuration API.

Version 2.6.3 - October, 2007
-----------------------------
• Moved the event handler that processes the request from the application's BeginRequest event to the PostAcquireRequestState event. This ensures that the session ID is available for cookie-less session processing.

Version 2.6.2 - July, 2007
--------------------------
• Added the BeforeEvaluateRequest event to allow subscribers the ability to cancel the evaluation of the current request.
  Create a handler in Global.asax defined as public void SecuritySwitch_BeforeEvaluateRequest(object sender, EvaluateRequestEventArgs e).

Version 2.6.1.1 - December, 2006
--------------------------------
• Bug fix: Accounted for a provided encryptedUri or unencryptedUri without the other.

Version 2.6.0.1 - November, 2006
--------------------------------
• Bug fix: With the added support for cookieless sessions, a bug arose where the request's query string was no longer being copied over during a redirect.

Version 2.6 - October, 2006
---------------------------
• The module now accounts for cookieless sessions when redirecting without a specified encryptedUri or unencryptedUri.
• A tiny change was made to the RequestEvaluator.Evaluate method that allows you to force an evaluation, despite the mode setting in the configuration. This should allow for better testing and simulation.

Version 2.5.1 - September, 2006
-------------------------------
• Bug fix: The module was adding an extra "/" when switching protocols between a specified encryptedUri and a protected directory. The SecuritySwitchSectionHandler's ReadChildItem method was selectively adding a "/" character to the beginning and/or ending of the item's Path property incorrectly. The code has been changed to remove all leading and trailing "/" characters.

Version 2.5 - February, 2006
----------------------------
• Separated appropriate logic into static helper classes. This adds benefit for testing purposes. Now, simple testing can be achieved by simulating the processes.
• Removed the configuration restriction of "order matters" for directory elements. Now, directory elements may be included in the configuration in any order. The module processes directory matches with the attitude that the deepest match is the best match. In other words, if a request is made for a page located in Admin/Reports/ and the configuration file has a directory element for both "Admin/" and "Admin/Reports/", it no longer matters if "Admin/" is first. Before, the module would stop once it found a match, despite recursion settings. Now, it finds the most accurate (deepest) match. Thanks goes out to balazs_hideghety for getting me started with this feature update.
• Bug fix: encryptedUri/unencryptedUri domain differing from current request domain. For example, if unencryptedUri="www.mysite.com", and the user visits a page via mysite.com, 4 characters ("www.") were dropped when the path is maintained during a redirect. This bug was squashed.

Version 2.1 - October, 2004
---------------------------
• Renamed the maintainApplicationPath attribute to maintainPath.
• Improved the code that redirects to another host via the encryptedUri and unencryptedUri.

Version 2.0 - May, 2004
-----------------------
• Source code provided in VB.NET, in addition to C#.
• The configuration settings loader is now called once in an Application Init event handler, and if the settings indicate to not use security, a handler for the BeginRequest event is not added. This improves the overall performance of the module and any application including it. Thanks goes to Diego.
• The root directory of the virtual application can now be secured by including a directory tag with a path of "/". Thanks to Andy for pointing this one out.
• A mode attribute was added to the securitySwitch section. Possible values are "On", "RemoteOnly", "LocalOnly" or "Off". Thanks to Andy for this suggestion.
• The encryptedUri and unencryptedUri attributes were added to the securitySwitch section. Set to a specific URI to indicate where the module should redirect when it decides that security is needed or not. Thanks to Andy for this suggestion.
• The maintainApplicationPath attribute was added to the securitySwitch section. A value of "False" will prevent the module from maintaining the current path when redirecting to any specified URIs.
• The warningBypassMode attribute was added to the securitySwitch section. Possible values are "AlwaysBypass", "NeverBypass" or "BypassWithQueryParam". This setting determines if the module will take steps to bypass security warnings in some browsers when switching from a secure request to an unsecure request.
• The bypassQueryParamName attribute was added to the securitySwitch section. Set the value to the name of a query string parameter that indicates to the module to bypass any security warning if warningBypassMode is set to "BypassWithQueryParam".
• The ignore attribute was removed from the file and directory tags.
• The secure attribute was added to the file and directory tags. Possible values are "True", "False" or "Ignore".
• directory tags may include the new recurse attribute. If "True", all files in any sub-directories are included.

Version 1.0 - November, 2003
----------------------------
• Initial release.
